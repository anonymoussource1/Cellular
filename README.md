# Cellular Automata

Inspired by the book *A New Kind of Science* by Stephan Wolframe.

Esentially, each new line is a new generation. There is a rule, and you apply that rule each generation. A rule consists of three squares, and the state of the square below the middle of the three is determined by the configuration of the three squares.

4. Maybe Julian would find interesting?
5. Mr. Netniss might too.
